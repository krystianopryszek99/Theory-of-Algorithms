## Overview
This repository contains lab work and assessment for Theory of Algorithms module. There are two jupyter notebooks which are used for the assessment, `post-correspondence.ipynb` and `countdown.ipynb`.

- **post-correspondence.ipynb**

  The post-correspondence notebook contains the definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem [1] and Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. A Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem and the explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory.

- **countdown.ipynb**

  The countdown.ipynb notebook contains an overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game [2] and the discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game. A python function to solve a Countdown Numbers Game. Finally an explanation of the functional aspects of the code.
