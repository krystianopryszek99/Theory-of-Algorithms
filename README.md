## Overview
This repository contains lab work and assessment for Theory of Algorithms module. There are two jupyter notebooks which are used for the assessment, `post-correspondence.ipynb` and `countdown.ipynb`.

- **post-correspondence.ipynb**

  The post-correspondence notebook contains the definition and explanation of the [Post Correspondence Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem) and Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. A Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. The function takes two lists of strings and returns True or False depending on if they correspond or not. This notebook also contains an explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory.

- **countdown.ipynb**

  The countdown notebook contains an overview and explanation of the [Countdown Numbers Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)). This notebook also contains the discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game. A python function to solve a Countdown Numbers Game, written in a [functional programming style](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html). The function takes a list of six numbers and a target number and returns a method to calculate the target from the numbers. Finally an explanation of the functional aspects of the code.
  
## How to run the notebooks
